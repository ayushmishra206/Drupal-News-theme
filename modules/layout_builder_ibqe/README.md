# Layout Builder Inline Block Quick Edit

Enable quick edit for layout builder inline blocks. This module is just a technical preview. 
**Don't use in Production** 

## Overview:
Right now it is not possible to "quick edit" layout builder inline blocks. See issue [Inline blocks shouldn't be editable via the normal block content UI](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3075308) for more details.
The problem is that the layout entity needs to get informed if a new block revision is created. 
To overcome this problem this module simple loads the latest revisions of an block for draft layout entities and activates the contextual menus. 
   
 
## Installation / configuration:
Simply install and enable the module. 

The development is still in very early stage.
